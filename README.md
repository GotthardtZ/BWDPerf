# BWDPerf

BWD is a dictionary coder, that provides sub-optimal dictionaries and patterned words.

## Structure of the repository

The repository contains a very efficient pipeline for compression, that will later be seperated in a different repo and (currently) no implementation of BWD. My goal is to implement BWD more efficiently than my PoC local project, hence the Perf in BWDPerf.

## Explanation

You'll find a very thorough explanation of how the algorithm works
